# Main Steps

1. Retrieve meta info from video url
2. Decide video topic from meta info with LLM call
3. Download video caption from Youtube (this can be done concurrently with step 1 and 2)
4. Group the caption into paragraph by lines
5. Concurrently summarize each paragraph with LLM call
6. Construct prompt based on selected topic (templates are generated by ChatGPT, but in implementation they should be carefully curated)
7. Generate markdown notes with LLM call and save locally
